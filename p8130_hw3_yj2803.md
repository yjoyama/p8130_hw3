# Problem 1

Let n = 189, $\bar{X}$ (sample mean) = 129.81, $s$ (sample standard
deviation) = 30.58

1)  Because we do not know the true population variance $\sigma^2$, 95%
    confidence interval of true mean weight can be obtained by the
    following:  
    $$\bar{X}-t_{n-1,1-\alpha/2}\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}, \bar{X}+t_{n-1,1-\alpha/2}\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$$

Thus, 95% confidence interval is (125.43, 134.2)

2)  We are 95% confident that the true mean weight of American women
    will be between (125.43, 134.2).

3)  The statement is not valid because 171 pounds is not included in the
    95% confidence interval.

# Problem 2

1)  Let $s_1$ and $s_2$ be the sample standard deviation from
    non-smoking group and smoking group accordingly. And let $n_1$ and
    $n_2$ be the number of observations in each group.  
    $\alpha=0.05$  
    $H_0$: the variances in two groups are equal  
    $H_1$: the variances in two groups are not equal

The test statistic is  
$F = \frac{s_1^2}{s_2^2}=$ 0.71 ~ $F_{n_1-1, n_2-1}$

Now, $F_{n_1-1, n_2-1, 1-\alpha/2}=$ 1.53 \> F  
Thus, we fail to reject the null hypothesis and accept $H_0$.

2)  The answer from part a indicates that the variances between two
    groups are equal at 5% significance level. Therefore, I will perform
    two-sample independent t-test for equal variances.

3)  $\alpha=0.10$ Let $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ be the population mean of the
    two groups. ($\bar{X_1}, \bar{X_2}$: sample mean)  
    $H_0$: $\mu_1=\mu_2$  
    $H_1$: $\mu_1\neq\mu_2$

The pooled estimate of the standard deviation
$s = \sqrt{\frac{(n_1-1)s_1^2+ (n_2-1)s_2^2}{n_1+n_2-2}}=$ 30.63

The test statistic is  
$t=\frac{\bar{X_1}- \bar{X_2}}{s\sqrt{\frac{1}{n_1}+\frac{1}{n_2}}}=$
0.6 ~ $t_{n_1+n_2-2}$

$t_{n_1+n_2-2,1-\alpha/2}=$ 1.65 \> t so we fail to reject the null
hypothesis and accept $H_0$.  
At 10% significance level, we can say that there is no statistically
significant difference in the motherâ€™s weight at last menstrual period
between smoking and non-smoking groups.

# Problem 3

1)  $\alpha=0.01$  
    Let p be the proportion of pregnant American women suffer from
    hypertension. ($p_0=$ 0.20)  
    I will perform one-sample test for binomial proportion.

99% confidence interval for one population proportion can be calculated
by:  
$$
\hat{p}-z_{1-\alpha/2}\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}, \hat{p}+z_{1-\alpha/2}\sqrt{\frac{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}{n}}
$$

Thus, 99% CI is (0.02, 0.11)

Because 0.20 is not included in the 99% CI, we can conclude that we are
99% confident that our data does not support this claim.

2)  $\alpha=0.01$  
    $H_0$: $p=p_0$  
    $H_1$: $p <p_0$

Test statistic is $z=\frac{\hat{p}-p_0}{\sqrt{p_0(1-p_0)/n}}=$ -4.69 ~
N(0, 1)

$z_{\alpha}=$ -1.28 \> $z$  
Therefore, we reject the null hypothesis and accept $H_1$. We can
conclude that at 10% significant level, the true proportion is indeed
less than the claimed 20%. \# Problem 4
