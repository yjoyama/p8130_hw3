# Problem 1

Let n = 189, $\bar{X}$ (sample mean) = 129.81, $s$ (sample standard
deviation) = 30.58

1)  Because we do not know the true population variance $\sigma^2$, 95%
    confidence interval of true mean weight can be obtained by the
    following:  
    $$\bar{X}-t_{n-1,1-\alpha/2}\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}, \bar{X}+t_{n-1,1-\alpha/2}\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$$

Thus, 95% confidence interval is (125.43, 134.2)

2)  We are 95% confident that the true mean weight of American women
    will be between (125.43, 134.2).

3)  The statement is not valid because 171 pounds is not included in the
    95% confidence interval.
